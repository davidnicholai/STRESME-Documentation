\begin{abstract}
From 150 to 200 words of short, direct and complete sentences, the abstract should be informative enough to serve as a substitute for reading the thesis itself.  It states the 
rationale and the objectives of the research.  In STTHES3, i.e., final thesis stage, the 
abstract should also contain a description of your research results/findings/contribution(s).
