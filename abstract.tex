\begin{abstract}
The hearing-impaired are not familiar with the way words are spoken because they do not know how different words sound like. One way to help the hearing-impaired is through speech training systems which teaches them how to speak. The proponents will create a speech training software that provides visual scalar feedback in order for the hearing-impaired to adjust to speaking different sounds. The speech training software will be limited to supporting only vowel sounds.
